# glio

A library for building Gleam (<http://gleam.run>) applications that interact with the API for Clio (<http://clio.com>), a cloud-based law practice management platform

## Status/Background

I am a lawyer. I am building a private application for my firm that interacts with Clio. I am building the Clio API interface as a library to share with others. 

It is not yet usable.
